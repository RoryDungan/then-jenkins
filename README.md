# Then Jenkins [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theverything/then-jenkins.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/theverything/then-jenkins)

This is a Node.js client for [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

This module is a wrapper around [node-jenkins](https://github.com/silas/node-jenkins) which uses promises instead of callbacks.

The API is the same an node-jenkins so refer to the docs there.
